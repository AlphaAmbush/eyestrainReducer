# Eye Strain Manager

The Eye Strain Manager is a simple desktop application built using Python and Tkinter. It helps users follow the 20-20-20 rule to prevent eye strain while working on screens for extended periods.

## Introduction

The 20-20-20 rule suggests that for every 20 minutes spent looking at a screen, you should take a break and look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. This practice helps reduce eye strain and discomfort caused by prolonged screen exposure.

## Features

- **Popup Reminder**: The app pops up a reminder window every 20 minutes, reminding the user to take a break.
- **Minimization**: After displaying the reminder, the app automatically minimizes itself after 20 seconds, allowing the user to continue their work uninterrupted.
- **Start Button**: The user can manually start the reminder process by clicking the "Start" button.

## Usage

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install tkinter playsound`.
2. Download the source code files (`main.py`, `icon.png`, `tone.mp3`) and save them in the same directory.
3. Run the `main.py` file using Python.
4. Click the "Start" button to initiate the reminder process.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions and take breaks as recommended.

## Dependencies

- **Tkinter**: Python's standard GUI library for creating desktop applications.
- **Playsound**: A Python library to play sound files.
